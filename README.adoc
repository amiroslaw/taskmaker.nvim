=== TODO

* [ ] links from task can be cut and add to annotation
* [ ] maybe one line task with metadata - it will be recognized one sub tasks wont inherit from the parent task
* [ ] multi lists, now it can add few lists but they will share the same contexts and projects, add tasklist separator

Known issues:
Adding task from the first selection could not work.

==  taskmaker.nvim ‚úÖ
This nvim plugin can create https://taskwarrior.org[Taskwarrior] or https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli[todo.txt] tasks from asciidoc or markdown checklists. I took the idea from the https://github.com/tools-life/taskwiki[taskwiki], but my plugin doesn't require additional dependencies and `VimWiki`. Taskmaker is smaller and restricted only to creating tasks from the selected text.

WARNING: Markdown format and todo.txt are not well tested because I use a different setup. üôÉ

=== Features

* Adding multiple tasks at once.
* Group of the tasks can inherent tags and metadata.¬†
* Extra function for toggling tasks as done or undone.
* Nested tasks.
* Taskwarrior dependency, any child tasks being marked as dependencies of the parent tasks. (only taskwarrior)
* URLs are automatically cut and added to the annotation. (only taskwarrior)

=== How to use
Select text and run `TaskmakerAddTasks` command. Tags from the title (the first line that starts with a dot followed by a character) will be added to each task. The task starts with a hyphen or an asterisk. Empty lines are omitted.

WARNING: Prefixes (doesn't apply to `annotation`) are only recognized on the title. For individual task you have to provide normal metadata.¬†

----
.asciidoc format +context-name #project-name !L (priority low)
* [ ] task 1
** [ ] task 1.1
*** [ ] task 1.1.1
* [ ] task 2

.markdown format (indents have 2 spaces) +context-name #project-name !F (priority F)
- [ ] task 1
  - [ ] task 1.1
    - [ ] task 1.1.1
- [ ] task 2

.taskwarrior metadata example #project-name due:eom
* [ ] extra project tag project:projectB
* [ ] overrated due due:tomorrow
* [ ] task with an annotation ann: annotation's text
* [ ] auto detected url  https://www.google.com  the url will be added to the annotation

More examples are available in the `test-cases.adoc` file on the `dev` branch.

=== Configuration
The configuration scheme is quite self-explanatory. If you use `todo.txt`, you have to change the `app` variable. For `sync` you have to set up synchronization in taskwarrior. The prefixes `wait`, `due` and `annotation` are available only for taskwarrior.

.Default configuration 
[source,lua]
----
local config = {
	app = 'taskwarrior', -- {'taskwarrior', 'todo.txt'}
	feedback = false, -- confirmation message feedback
	default_context = '', -- useful for the GTD inbox convention
	sync = false, -- synchronization (only for taskwarrior)
	spaces_number = 2, -- for markdown's nested checklist
	prefix = {
		project = '#',
		context = '+',
		priority = '!',
		wait = 'wait:',
		due = 'due:',
		annotation = 'ann:',
	},
}

----

Taskmaker provides only two commands `TaskmakerAddTasks` and `TaskmakerToggle`.

	vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('v','<LocalLeader>t', '<cmd>TaskmakerAddTasks <CR>')
	vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n','<LocalLeader>x', '<cmd>TaskmakerToggle <CR>')

=== Todo and remarks

* [ ] Known issue: Adding tasks from the first selection could not work. I‚Äôm not an expert in nvim, I just don‚Äôt know where the problem is.
* [ ] Range selection doesn't work.
* [ ] Vim documentation.
